# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to create a responsive page in Flask that displayed the results of a web scrape for data on Mars. Three deliverables were part of this assignment:

1. Code to scrape high-resolution images of Mars hemispheres

2. Code to update our Flask webpage/index.html to display these scrapped hemisphere images

3. Customization of the index.html used by Flask with Bootstrap 3 components, while also making the webpage mobile-responsive
